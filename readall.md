A git rooted deep in the forest of forks with remarkable branches


## repo of repos' 
I've mainly created this to be a primary container, or an inverse root if you will, as I'll be doing a consolidated effort of attempting to consolidate the gits into a single console of consolidation. 

## reasoning
Due to the vast rabbit-holes found within these woods, coupled with the moles creating alternate paths to sometimes even deeper holes, I figured now was the time to try and mitigate this with the help of some elves often found in these trees.  

## sources cited
As this consolidates all sauces for the given repos not my own will be specified, and any and all licensing would be that of the dev(s) for/of the given repo in question. 

## your house
In the event that these consolidations happen to include your special sauce, and you rather it not, please let me know and it'll be downgraded to our free tier of a hyperlink. If you'd rather be one of our super platinum triple diamond global organization government world leader king supreme plan members (in limited supply, so HURRY!) then give me a business email, number, social, vin, and signup for our removal-as-a-service sans mail campaign while in beta. 

## your rules
Joking, I can't maintain my current sprawl as it is, and I know for a fact that I wouldn't be able to handle that billion dollar startup. If you let me know though I'll remove it. 

## and again
Everything that will transpire here is not an effort to cheat, shortchange, circumvent, or frankly fuck over the originating devs who deserve the credit for their work. Please remember, these gits == their shit + their license. 

## the daft
FOR any unfortunate souls that stumble upon this - DO NOT be like these other dickheads by either not crediting them or respecting the given license they've chosen. 


## the lame
TO any other jackass that thinks it's now theirs - DO NOT use me as some dumbass MiTM type repo for these other awesome projects. 

## the feeble
FROM some of these tumbles there might be additions, notes, scripts, expansions, corections, and any other variuos dumb shit I come up with as it strikes. 

### the warnings

If you still choose to go spelunking there are warnings to heed


## too much
- _I am not a developer by any stretch of the imagination_ 
- The most creative crap I ever come up with is above 
- Anything from me WILL be over thought without question
- Thoughts WILL become over analysed till sensible
- Explanations WILL be given in the literal context
- Variations WILL be abundant making the least sense
- Continuations WILL be continuously integrated from various explanations of my thoughts till broken <- [breaking point]

## tipping point
-+ Usefulness WILL usually happen right after in spaghetti tests
> If your asking Oo spaghetti tests? I mean fuck it. Throw it against the wall, if that shit sticks great, and if not strip it and throw again. 


## and then
- Rarely happens now, but get naked bitch mode will hit here. 
- Since I'm a dummy that also means I'm in the M$ winders world. 
- Winders will bitch, yet be fine running the exact same script later.
- Don't care enough anymore to research a why and/or workaround.
> Get naked bitch Oo? I strip it down to the bare minimum to make it happen. Don't care about variables, variations, or unintentional actions.  

## they work
*Both of these versions WILL work just not tested to levels I prefer.* 

__Anything else I do add WILL work and be thoroughly tested__

## not enough

+ If TL;DR/Tik-Tok is more your style skip straight to here 
+ If simple vertical integration is all then here's the area

## need more
+ If Cisco/RedBook is your level then you missed your floor
+ If multi-tiered auto/choose actions/chains you want earlier stop
+ If multi-tiered without the logic is all the pieces are here

## get some
+ If clarification or help is ever needed just let me know
+ If some script is too vertical, and you might need X, just let me know
+ If you expect some sort of script for everything here, Your nuts.
